As a user I want to control who can do what over the database and APIs. If someone is just a viewer, they should only be able to view art. If someone is an artist than they can view others art, create and upload their own art, and control how that art is viewed by others. Admins should be able to manage the database and control what goes in. If something is inappropriate it should be able to be removed.   
As a User I want to add functionality that allows users to follow others and share comments and likes on pieces of art.   
As a User I want others to be able to upload their art to a gallery where they can create folders of their various art pieces. They will then be able to share specific folders with others, or share them all with everyone.
